                                10.1. The Agreement is a complete agreement between the Operator and the User. The
                                Operator

                                Agreement, except as expressly provided in the Agreement, except when such terms or
                                obligations are fixed in writing and signed by the Operator and the User.<br>
                                10.2. The terms of this Agreement are regulated by the legislation of Ukraine. Any
                                disputes

                                consent of the Parties. If such an agreement can not be reached, the Parties have the
                                right

                                this
                                does not mean his waiver of such rights in any subsequent violation.<br>
                                10.5. Recognition of any provision or clause of this Agreement or its annexes is not
                                valid,
                                does not affect the validity of the remaining terms and conditions of the Agreement.<br>
                                10.6. Upon acceptance of the terms and conditions of the Offer of this Agreement, all
                                previous Service Agreements concluded earlier with the Contractor expire.
